ELK stands for ElasticSearch LogStash Kibana
ELK stack is a combination of 3 open-source tools: ELasticsearch, Logstach & Kibana for log analysis.

LOGSTASH will collect the logs from System logs, Log files, kafka Queues etc. Then it will create a pipeline and then send data
through that pipeline to ELATICSEARCH and ELASTICSEARCH will store that data(logs) in different indices. Fianlly if you want to search that
data at anypoint of time or you want to perfom analytics that all is done with the help of KIBANA. So KIBANA makes Queries in Elasticsearch
to do all of this

ELasticSearch: it does all the analytics of the logs

Logstash: (does the log collection) Tool for collecting and monitoring logs from remote machines. It is a data pipeline for Elasticsearch.

Kibana: Kibana is a tool that provides front end (UI) to your ELK stack. Be it searching the data, performing analytics, creating reports
        all these things are done on Kibana. You do the searching via kibana and kibana actually goes searches Elaticsearch for that 
        particular data.
       - It is a Data exploration & visualization tool.
       - Used for log & time series analytics, application monitoring and operational Intelligence.
       
KIBANA
- Enables the searching & interaction with data in Elasticsearch
- Allows performing advanced analytics & creation of reports
- Enables creation & sharing of dynamic dashboards that get updated in realtime
( Note: Kibana is a web based tool i.e. you interact kibana over the web. Kibana is accesed over the web at port localhost:5601 )
